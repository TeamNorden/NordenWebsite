## Contributing
Currently we don't *really* accept PRs for new features and such, with that being said we very much appreciate bug fixes, design fixes and little things as such.

Here's a high level guide on how to spin up a development version of the website:
- `yarn`
- **Follow the [.env.template](https://github.com/TeamNorden/NordenWebsite/blob/main/.env.template) file and fill it out. Rename it to `.env.testing` for development purposes, or `.env.production` for live, production purposes.**
- `yarn start:dev`
